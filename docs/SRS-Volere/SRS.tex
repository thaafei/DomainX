\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

This section identifies existing tools, software, and components that could be leveraged to reduce development time and cost for the Neural Network Libraries (NNL) Assessment Tool. It outlines reusable libraries and products that can be legally copied or adapted to accelerate development and ensure maintainability.

The goal is to reuse proven, reliable components and avoid reinventing existing functionality, thereby optimizing development effort and leveraging established best practices.

\subsection{Ready-Made Products}

Several existing platforms provide partial functionality aligned with the tool’s goals, particularly in data visualization, analytics, and automation. However, none fully satisfy the requirement for automated data gathering, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis, and integrated visualization.

\begin{table}[hp]
\caption{Ready-Made Products Relevant to the NNL Assessment Tool}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{2.8cm}X X X}
\toprule
\textbf{Product} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Relevance to Project} & \textbf{Limitations} \\
\midrule
Microsoft Excel & Spreadsheet with storage, formulas, and charts. & Used as baseline for current manual process. & Lacks automation, scalability, and centralized access. \\
\addlinespace[0.3em]

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

These products may serve as inspiration or integration points (e.g., Excel import/export) but cannot replace the custom automation and analysis required by the NNL Assessment Tool.

\subsection{Reusable Components}

The following open-source libraries and frameworks will be incorporated to support data collection, analysis, and visualization.

\begin{table}[hp]
\caption{Reusable Components}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{2.8cm}X X X}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Purpose} & \textbf{Source} & \textbf{Justification} \\
\midrule

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Reusing these components ensures consistency, leverages reliability, and minimizes custom development effort.

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}

Some open-source or academic research dashboards share functional similarities with the NNL Assessment Tool and may inform design or architecture.

\begin{table}[hp]
\caption{Products That Can Be Copied or Adapted}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{3cm}X X}
\toprule
\textbf{Product} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Adaptation Potential} \\
\midrule
Software Assessment Dashboards & Tools that analyze open-source metrics. & Their structure can guide data collection and dashboard design. \\
\addlinespace[0.3em]
University Research Repositories & Academic dashboards for research analytics. & Useful for UI and data categorization strategies. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
