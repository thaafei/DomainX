\section{The Scope of the Product}
\subsection{Product Boundary}
This system aims to simplify and streamline the process of collecting, managing, and analyzing data to assess the state of the practice for various research domains. It replaces the existing, manual process (currently managed via Excel sheets) and formalizes the methodology outlined in the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11575}{Methodology for Assessing the State of the Practice for Domain X paper}. The final system will be a secure, accessible, data management and analysis tool.

The system will provide the following core functionality:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Security and User Management:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Securely manage user accounts (login, password changes).
    \item Accounts can only be created by an administrator invitation.
    \item Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    \item Ensure only authenticated users can modify data.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Integrity and Auditing:} Maintain an audit trail for all data entries, logging when a change is made.
  \item \textbf{Core Data Operations:} Facilitate the storing, updating, and retrieving of all core research entities: research domains, libraries, and collected metrics.
  \item \textbf{Data Collection:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Support mass data upload from previous research work.
    \item Automatically collect data to populate a specified data table (e.g., State-of-Practice Metrics Table).
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Analysis and Visualization:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implement an AHP-based ranking of libraries within a domain based on their state of practice.
    \item Visualize data as different 2D graphs, showing the difference between libraries in a domain.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User Experience (UX):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have an intuitive UI to improve overall user experience.
    \item Ensure accessible read permissions for all users.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Export:} Allow users to download tables or graphs onto their local device.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The following capabilities are explicitly excluded from the initial scope:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Communication:} The system will not facilitate scheduling or hosting meetings between researchers and domain experts.
  \item \textbf{User Data:} Only username, email, and password will be collected for user profiles, no need for personal information.
  \item \textbf{Fine-Grained Permissions:} The system will not separate domain access by researcher. All authenticated researchers will be able to view and edit any domain.
  \item \textbf{Data/Library Recommendations:} The system will not give users suggestions on which library to use based on insufficient information.
  \item \textbf{Data Imputation/Handling:} The system will not automatically fill in missing data, nor will it incorporate a mechanism to assume the possibility of missing data during AHP calculation.
  \item \textbf{System Management:} The system will not include functionality for adding or removing administrator accounts.
  \item \textbf{AHP Validation:} The system will not include functionality to check the accuracy of the AHP calculations.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The following items are recognized as potential enhancements but are considered low-priority:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Auditing:} Logging who edited the data entries.
  \item \textbf{Conflict Resolution:} Creating a method for merging changes when multiple users edit the same data simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Product Use Case Table}

\toprule
\textbf{Use Case (Goal)} & \textbf{Primary Actor} & \textbf{Secondary Actor(s)} & \textbf{Key Functional Requirements (FRs)} \\ \hline
\midrule
Invite New Users & Admin & Researcher & Admin can input a new user email. New user will receive an email with a link that will allow them to setup an account, password, and username. \\  \hline
Domain Creation \& Setup & Admin & Researcher & Create new Domain (must validate unique name). Optional: Add description to the domain. \\  \hline
Publish Domain & Researcher & General Users & Once the data collection is finished, allow anyone to see it (General Users). \\  \hline

Manually Input/Update Data & Researcher & System & Add missing data through the data table. Missing data must be highlighted in red. Only allow user to input right format (e.g., numbers, text). Maintain an audit trail of changes. \\  \hline
Ranking (AHP) & Researcher & System & System will run the integrated AHP tool using input quality scores and expert pairwise comparisons to automatically calculate the final package rankings. Run process automatically when the table is filled and updated. \\  \hline
Visualize \& Export Results & General User / Researcher / Admin & System & Allow selection of domain, libraries, and metrics to 2D graphs. Allow download of collected data (JSON/Excel). Allow download of graphs (PNG/LaTeX). \\  \hline
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Individual Product Use Cases (PUC's)}
Important things to keep in mind when looking at the at the Use Case Diagram:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Include: A - include -> B means, if A is executed that means B will be executed as well. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Update Data - include -> Login, if user wanted to Update Data they must Login.
    \item Login - include -> Verify Account, when user tries login the system will verify account.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Extend: A <- extends - B means, if A is executed that means that B could be executed as well but not in all cases.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Create New Domain <- extends - Mass Data Upload:Create New Domain could also mean that the user wants to upload previous work, which would need a mass data upload, but not in all cases.
    \item Login <- extends - Failed Login: When trying to login the user might fail to do so, however it's not always the case.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Costs}
There is no development cost for this project, due to the nature of this being a capstone project. 
\\
The costs of hosting the required services, such as the database and the web application will depend on McMaster University's existing infrastructure.
\\
However, estimating using a common cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). \\
Using the Relational Database Service (RDS) for database and the Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) service for hosting.
Assuming around a maximum usage of 20 Hours/Month, the total cost of hosting is 11.63 CAD per month, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:price_table}.
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{} X X X c @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Estimated Usage} & \textbf{Total Cost} \\
\midrule
RDS for MySQL & Two vCPU and 8GB of Memory & 20 Hours/Month & 9.76 CAD/Month \\ 
EC2 & t4g.large Instance & 20 Hours/Month & 1.87 USD/Month \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Price estimates and total costs for two AWS services.}
\label{tab:price_table}
\end{table}

\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Manual}
The user manual will highlight the key features of the product, and provide additional details for installing, setup and usage that wasn't previously covered in the project's \href{https://github.com/thaafei/DomainX/blob/main/README.md}{README}. \\
\\The maintenance of this document will be the responsibility of the development team. Changes to the product's features, such as adding new features or altering existing features must be reflected in the user manual upon release of the update.

\subsubsection{Release Manual}
The release manual will cover the release process required for future releases of the product, found in the \href{https://github.com/thaafei/DomainX/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan}. It should include the whole CI/CD lifecycle, including team standards, release labelling, and more.\\
\\The maintenance of this document will be the responsibility of the development team. Changes to the CI/CD process, either from the development team or the broader McMaster University infrastructure team should be reflected before the next release.

\subsection{Training Requirements}
\textbf{1. Users should be able to use the tool and utilize key features immediately after following the tutorial} \\ \\
\textbf{2. Users should be able to find key features without consulting additional documentation 95\% of the time.} \\ \\
The responsibilty of the training will first fall towards the development team of the tool. They must ensure the provided in-tool tutorial is up-to-date and sufficient to help a user understand all key features.
\\ Additional training will be provided to the supervisor, hosted by the development team.
Subsequent training will be the responsibility of the supervisor, if needed to train future users of the tool, in the format that the supervisor chooses.
\section{Waiting Room}
\textbf{1. Comparing across Domains}\\
The user should be able to compare two (or more) completed domain analysis against each other. \\\\
\textbf{2. Versioning of Domains}\\
Users can revist and update completed domains, adding new data or editing existing ones. Allowing users to view the evolution of the state of best practice for the domain.

\section{Ideas for Solution}
The following is the development team's idea for the user interface of the tool. Figure~\ref{fig:domainx_ui} shows the initial concept, drawing inspiration from \href{https://octave-online.net/}{Octave Online}, the cloud IDE for Matlab.
\\ The main section of the tool will be where the data is displayed and gathered for each domain. With the sections that can be automatically gathered differentiated using a different colour, such as the gray shown in Figure~\ref{fig:domainx_ui}.
\\ The left sidebar will contain all the domains, with indications on whether it's completed or not. As well as providing a filter to quickly search for a specific domain.
